# GraphQL example code for talk

Included is the repo that I used during my GraphQL talk
I use ReactJS on the client, with Apollo as the middleware (client and server) and GraphQL as the data layer.

This repo utilizes both an attached MongoDB instance (with Mongoose) as well as some 3rd party API's to show how to grab data from any source and bring it into your GraphQL schema through the resolver functions
